<h2>About SIPcon1</h2>
<p>
SIPcon1 is a free, accessible IP textphone created by Trace Center - 
University of Wisconsin and Omnitor AB in a joint cooperation. The aim 
of the project is to create a sample program that implements text over 
IP (ToIP) according to the protocols and procedures endorsed by ETSI as 
being preferred for implementation of real time text conversation in the 
SIP host environment. The intension is to encourage compatible and fully 
functional implementations of real time text over IP.
</p>
<p>
The application communicates with other units, such as IP telephones 
and other soft phones, with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

SIPcon1 uses the following standards and recommendations:
</p>
<ul>
<li>RFC3261, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</li>
<li>RFC2327, Session Description Protocol (SDP)</li>
<li>RFC3551, RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control</li>
<li>RFC4103, RTP Payload for Text Conversation</li>
<li>ITU-T G.711</li>
<li>ITU-T G.723</li>
